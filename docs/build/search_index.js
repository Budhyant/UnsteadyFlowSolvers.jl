These can be used to create plots and movies of the\nflowfield.\n\n`delvort` is used to control the vortex count. The simulation cost\nincreases as O(n``^2``) with number of vortices in the flow field and so\nlong run times can get very computationally expensive. Look at\n`?delVortDef` for algorthims to control vortex count.\n\n`maxwrite` is the maximum number of timestamps/directories that may be\nwritten.\n\n`nround` is the number of digits to which the output timestamps are\nrounded off to.\n\nThe Large-Angle Unsteady Thin-Airfoil theory is described in: Ramesh,\nK. et al., \"An unsteady airfoil theory applied to pitching motions\nvalidated against experiment and computation\", Theor. Comput. Fluid\nDyn. (2013) 27: 843. [Weblink](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00162-012-0292-8)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"}]
